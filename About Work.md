The Foodpanda Customer & Operational Analytics Project is an end-to-end data analysis initiative designed to uncover meaningful insights from real-world food delivery patterns. Using the provided dataset, this project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, restaurant demand trends, delivery performance, and service experience to support operational excellence and strategic decision-making.

🔍 1. Data Understanding & Preparation

The raw dataset contained 31 columns covering customer demographics, order details, delivery information, restaurant attributes, ratings, and payment details.
Key steps included:

Handling missing values and removing unnecessary blank columns

Formatting date fields (order date, signup date)

Standardizing categorical values like gender, delivery status, and meal type

Detecting outliers in delivery time, order value, and rating columns

Structuring the dataset for pivot tables and dashboards
This cleaning process created a reliable foundation for accurate insights.

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to identify hidden patterns and operational trends, including:

Customer Demographics: Gender distribution, age segment analysis (Teen, Adult, Senior), and city-wise customer density

Order Behavior: Popular restaurants, most frequently ordered dishes, monthly/seasonal order trends

Delivery Performance: On-time vs delayed vs cancelled deliveries, delivery duration distribution, bottleneck indicators

Customer Satisfaction: Relationship between delivery time, restaurant, and ratings

Revenue Insights: High-value customers, frequently used payment methods, meal-time revenue contribution

This step helped connect customer preferences with platform performance.
